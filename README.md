This project was implemented during the opencodes hackathon @ ZKM Karlsruhe (24./25. March 2018). The team consists of Lucas S., Jonas F., Lukas K. and Simon H.

The project comprises an Android app that captures pictures from the camera and sends it to a server that applies a image captioning model (Vinyals et al. 2016, Show and Tell: Lessons learned from the 2015 MS-COCO Image Captioning Challenge). The result is then delivered to the user by both Text-To-Speech and a textual output on the screen.
This app can assist visually impaired people with understanding the scenery they currently are in.
